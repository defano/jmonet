/**
 * A scratch buffer on which to draw ephemeral changes to the canvas.
 * <p>
 * The scratch buffer provides a graphic context on which paint tools can draw without modifying the canvas. For
 * example, the selection tool needs a layer on which to draw marching ants that does not result in the ants becoming
 * part of the underlying graphic. In general, all tools should draw on the scratch buffer until the change is ready to
 * be committed to the canvas; for many tools (like the paintbrush, pencil, line, or rectangle), the change is complete
 * only when the user releases the mouse.
 * <p>
 * The scratch buffer provides two scratch "modes": an "add" scratch for changes that add paint to the canvas, and a
 * "remove" scratch for changes that erase paint from the canvas. The add scratch works by overlaying the scratch
 * graphic to the canvas using composite mode {@link AlphaComposite#SRC_OVER}; the remove scratch uses
 * {@link AlphaComposite#DST_OUT}.
 * <p>
 * The dimension of the scratch buffer always matches the dimension of the canvas, but for performance, the scratch
 * buffer manages a dirty region to paint only the portion of the buffer that the tool has modified.
