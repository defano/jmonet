# JMonet

An easy-to-use toolkit for incorporating paint tools similar to [MacPaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint) or [Microsoft Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) into a Java Swing or JavaFX application.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/defano/jmonet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/defano/jmonet)

## Features

* Standard suite of paint tools with common modifier-key constraints (e.g., hold shift to snap lines to nearest 15-degree angle).
* Paint canvas supports undo and redo operations on all tool changes; plus cut, copy and paste integration with the system clipboard.
* Variety of image transform tools like scale, rotate, shear, perspective and projection, plus the ability to adjust color depth, transparency and brightness.
* Canvas can be magnified and displayed within a scrollable pane; tools can be snapped to a grid.
* Lightweight toolkit integrates easily into Swing and JavaFX applications and utilizes [ReactiveX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for observables.
* Images are backed by a standard Java `BufferedImage` object making it easy to import and export graphics.

## Paint Tools

JMonet provides the following suite of paint tools:

### Selection tools

Icon                                  | Tool         | Description
--------------------------------------|--------------| -------------------------
![Lasso](icons/lasso.png)             | Lasso        | Define a free-form selection boundary ([marching ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_ants)) for clearing or moving paint.
![Selection](icons/selection.png)     | Selection    | Define a selection rectangle ([marching ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_ants)) whose underlying graphic can be moved or cleared (press `delete`)

### Transform tools

Icon                                  | Tool         | Description
--------------------------------------|--------------| -------------------------
![Rotate](icons/rotate.png)           | Rotate       | Define a selection, then use the drag handle to free-rotate the selected graphic around its center. Hold shift to restrict rotation angle to 15-degree increments.
![Slant](icons/slant.png)             | Slant        | Define a selection, then use the drag handles to apply an affine shear transform to the selected graphic.

![Projection](icons/distort.png)      | Projection   | Define a selection, then use the drag handles to project the image onto the geometry of an arbitrary quadrilateral.
![Perspective](icons/perspective.png) | Perspective  | Define a selection, then use the drag handles to warp the image onto an isosceles trapezoid, providing the effect of the left or right side of the image appearing nearer or farther from the viewer.
![Rubber Sheet](icons/distort.png)    | Rubber Sheet | Similar to the projection transform, but utilizes a "rubber sheet" algorithm that preserves relative position over linearity.

### Image transforms

Once a selection has been made, invoke one of the following methods on the `PaintTool` object to transform its selection:

Transform               | Tool Availability             | Description
------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------
`adjustBrightness`      | Selection and transform tools | Changes the brightness/luminosity of all pixels in the selected image by adding `delta` to each red, green and blue color channel value (a value between 0..255, where 0 is completely dark, 255 is completely light).
`adjustTransparency`    | Selection and transform tools | Changes the opacity of each pixel in the selected image by adding `delta` the alpha channel (a value between 0..255 where 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque).
`removeTranslucency`    | Selection and transform tools | Makes translucent pixels either fully transparent of fully opaque.          
`applyTransform`        | Selection tools               | Applies an `AffineTransform` or a `PixelTransform` to the selection.
`fill`                  | Selection and transform tools | Fills any fully-transparent pixels in the selection with a given `Paint`.
`flipHorizontal`        | Selection tools               | Flips the selection about a vertical axis drawn through the center of the image.
`flipVertical`          | Selection tools               | Flips the selection about a horizontal axis drawn through the center of the image.
`invert`                | Selection and transform tools | Inverts the color
`pickupSelection`       | Selection tools               | "Picks up" the pixels on the canvas that are currently within the bounds of the selection and adds them to the selection. Useful when moving a selection over another region of the canvas.
`reduceColor`           | Selection and transform tools | Performs a color quantization and dithers the result using a specified dithering algorithm. See the `com.defano.algo.dither` package for available dithering implementations (or implement your own).
`reduceGreyscale`       | Selection and transform tools | Performs a luminosity quantization and dithers the result using a specified dithering algorithm.
`rotateLeft`            | Selection tools               | Rotates the selection 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
`rotateRight`           | Selection tools               | Rotates the selection 90 degrees clockwise.

## Getting started

#### 1. Install the library

JMonet is published to Maven Central; include the library in your Maven project's POM, like:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.defano.jmonet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmonet</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```

... or your Gradle build script:

```
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.defano.jmonet:jmonet:0.2.4'
}
```

#### 2. Create a canvas

JMonet integrates easily into Java Swing and JavaFX applications. Simply create a canvas node or panel and add it to a window in your application:

In Swing applications:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {

        // Create and show Swing frame
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("My Pretty Picture");
        frame.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(640, 480));
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);

        // Create a JMonet canvas and add it to the window
        JMonetCanvas myCanvas = new JMonetCanvas(new Dimension(640, 480));
        frame.getContentPane().add(myCanvas);
    });
}
```

In JavaFX applications:

```
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {

    // Create a JFX node for our paint canvas
    JFXPaintCanvasNode myCanvas = new JFXPaintCanvasNode(new JMonetCanvas(new Dimension(640, 480)));

    // Create a pane for it
    StackPane pane = new StackPane();
    pane.getChildren().add(myCanvas);

    // And add it to our stage
    stage.setScene(new Scene(pane, 640, 480));
    stage.show();
}

```

#### 3. Pick up a tool

Start painting by making a tool active on the canvas with the `PaintToolBuilder`:

```
PaintTool activeTool = PaintToolBuilder.create(PaintToolType.PAINTBRUSH)
    .withStroke(StrokeBuilder.withShape().ofCircle(8).build())
    .withStrokePaint(Color.RED)
    .makeActiveOnCanvas(myCanvas)
    .build();
```

Voila! You're ready to start painting a round, 8-pixel, bright red brushstroke onto your canvas. Don't forget to deactivate this tool when you're done with it or wish to start using another tool:

```
// When you're done painting or ready for a different tool...
activeTool.deactivate();
```

There's no technical limitation that prevents multiple tools from being active on the same canvas at the same time, but that's not usually desired behavior in a paint program.

### Creating complex brush shapes

A stroke represents the size and shape of the "pen" used to mark the outline of a shape or path.

JMonet's `ShapeStroke` class can produce a stroke of any arbitrary shape (even the shape of text). A builder class (`StrokeBuilder`) provides a convenient mechanism for creating both `BasicStroke` or `ShapeStroke` objects. Note that `StrokeBuilder` replaces the `BasicBrush` enumeration present in older versions of the library.

To produce a stroke in the shape of a vertical line, 20 pixels tall:

```
StrokeBuilder.withShape()
    .ofVerticalLine(20)
    .build();
```

Stroked shapes can be transformed, too. This produces a 20x10 parallelogram stroke:

```
StrokeBuilder.withShape()
    .ofRectangle(20, 10)
    .sheared(1, 0)
    .build();
```

Shapes can be combined together to create a composite stroke shape. This example produces a stroke in the shape of the international [no symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_symbol):

```
StrokeBuilder.withShape()
    .ofCircle(48)         // draw circle
    .outlined(6)          // ... outlined with 6px border, not filled
    .ofRectangle(6, 60)   // draw slash (6px wide, 60px long)
    .rotated(-45)         // ... rotate it 45 degrees
    .build();
```

Instances of Java's `BasicStroke` can also be created with this builder. This example produces an 8-pixel stroke with a 10-pixel dashed pattern:

```
StrokeBuilder.withBasicStroke()
    .ofWidth(8)
    .withDash(10)
    .build();
```

## Implement cut, copy and paste

JMonet makes it easy to integrate cut, copy and paste functions into your app that utilize the operating system's clipboard so that you can copy and paste graphics from within your own application or between other applications on your system.

A bit of integration is required to connect these functions to the UI elements in your app (like menu items or toolbar buttons) that a user will interact with.

#### 1. Route actions to the canvas

The JMonet canvas will not receive cut, copy or paste actions until we register an `ActionListener` that routes those actions to it. Typically, only the user interface element that has focus receives such events, but because a canvas has no clear concept of focus, it's up to you to decide when the canvas should respond to cut, copy and paste actions.

Create an `ActionListener` to send actions to the canvas:

```
CanvasClipboardActionListener myActionListener = new CanvasClipboardActionListener(new CanvasFocusDelegate() {
    @Override
    public AbstractPaintCanvas getCanvasInFocus() {

        // Should our canvas handle cut, copy and paste commands right now?
        if (isMyCanvasInFocus()) {
            return myCanvas;
        }

        // If not, return null
        return null;
    }
});
```

Then, add this `ActionListener` to whichever user interface elements will generate cut, copy and paste events. Most commonly this would be added to menu items but could also be used with buttons on a toolbar, for example:

```
JMenuItem myCopyMenuItem = new JMenuItem(new DefaultEditorKit.CopyAction());
copyMenuItem.setName("Copy");
copyMenuItem.setActionCommand((String) TransferHandler.getCopyAction().getValue(Action.NAME))
copyMenuItem.addActionListener(myActionListener);

myEditMenu.add(myCopyMenuItem);
```

#### 2. Add the transfer handler

Your application needs to tell JMonet what to do when the user has invoked the cut, copy or paste action. Typically, this simply involves getting or setting the selection defined by a selection tool (i.e., any tool which subclasses `AbstractSelectionTool`). Of course, you're free to provide alternate behavior (like copying the entire canvas, instead of just the selection).

The code below provides an implementation that cuts, copies and pastes the active selection.

```
  JMonetCanvas myCanvas = new JMonetCanvas();

  myCanvas.setTransferHandler(new CanvasTransferHandler(myCanvas, new CanvasTransferDelegate() {
    @Override
    public BufferedImage copySelection() {
      if (myActiveTool instanceof AbstractSelectionTool) {
        return ((AbstractSelectionTool) myActiveTool).getSelectedImage();
      }

      // Nothing available to copy if active tool isn't a selection tool
      return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void deleteSelection() {
      // Nothing to do if active tool isn't a selection tool
      if (activeTool instanceof AbstractSelectionTool) {
        ((AbstractSelectionTool) activeTool).deleteSelection();
      }
    }

    @Override
    public void pasteSelection(BufferedImage image) {
      // Make selection tool active...
      SelectionTool tool = (SelectionTool) PaintToolBuilder
        .create(SelectionTool)
        .makeActiveOnCanvas(myCanvas)
        .build();

      // ... then create a new selection from the pasted image
      tool.createSelection(image, new Point(0, 0));
    }
})

```

## Frequently asked questions

#### I don't get it. Doesn't Java's `Graphics` already let me draw stuff?

If you're not building an app that lets users paint lines and shapes with the mouse, this probably isn't for you.

Java's `Graphics` context does indeed provide routines for stroking and filling primitive shapes, but there's a quite a bit of work involved to map mouse and keyboard events into these calls the way a "paint" app expects. Getting scale, grids, and transforms to work correctly is a bit more complex than merely delegating to `AffineTransform`, too.

#### How do I save my artwork?

Get the image from the canvas via the `public BufferedImage getCanvasImage()` method. Then, use Java's `ImageIO` class to save as `gif`, `png` or `jpg`. For more advanced file type support (such as `wbmp`, `bmp`, `pcx`, `pnm`, `raw` or `tiff`), consider the [Java Advanced ImageIO](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/imageio/index.html) library.

You could also save just the selection defined by a selection tool using `selectionTool.getSelectedImage()`.

#### How do I import images from files or elsewhere?

You'll need your image in the form of a Java `BufferedImage` object. Use Java's ImageIO or Advanced ImageIO to [read/deserialize existing files or data](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/images/loadimage.html).

Then, you have three options:

1. Create a new canvas from an existing `BufferedImage` object like: `new JMonetCanvas(myImage)`. Best option when opening a file for editing.
2. Use the selection tool to create a new selection containing your image: `selectionTool.createSelection(myImage, new Point(0,0))`. Best option when pasting an image into to an existing canvas (and you'd like to allow the user to move it into place).
3. Commit the image to an existing canvas by drawing it onto the scratch buffer and committing the change, like: `myCanvas.setScratchImage(myImage); myCanvas.commit()`. Best option when you want to programmatically overlay an image onto an existing canvas.

Note that in cases 1 and 3, if the imported image does not match the dimensions of the canvas, it will be drawn in the upper-left corner. Resize and translate the image you wish to import first if you'd like it to appear elsewhere.

#### If I create a selection using `LassoTool`, can I modify it with a transform tool (like `ProjectionTool`) or do I have to create a new selection from scratch with the transform tool?

You can transfer a selection from one selection tool to another (including transform tools) using the `morphSelection()` method:

```
LassoTool currentTool;
ProjectionTool newTool = PaintToolBuilder.create(...);

currentTool.morphSelection(newTool);  // newTool now has currentTool's selection  
currentTool.deactivate();             // ... but currentTool is still active.
```

When morphing a Lasso selection to a transform tool, the selection bounds will become rectangular, but only the pixels originally encircled by the Lasso will be affected by the transform.

#### Can I create my own tools?

Of course! Tools are typically subclassed from one of the abstract tool classes in the `paint.tools.base` package. These abstract classes handle UI events for the most common tool behaviors:

Tool Base                | Description
-------------------------|------------
`PaintTool`              | Base class from which all paint tools are derived. Holds references to attribute providers and implements empty mouse and keyboard event handlers (_template pattern_; allows tools to override only those methods they care about).
`AbstractBoundsTool`     | Click-and-drag to define a rectangular boundary. Examples: Rectangle, Oval, Round Rectangle, Shape tools.
`AbstractLineTool`       | Click-and-drag to define a line between two points. Example: Line tool.
`AbstractPathTool`       | Click-and-drag to define a free-form path on the canvas. Examples: Paintbrush, pencil, eraser tools.
`AbstractPolylineTool`   | Click-click-click-double-click to define segments in a polygon or curve. Examples: Curve, Polygon tools.
`AbstractSelectionTool`  | Most complex of the tool bases; click-and-drag to define a shape to be drawn with marching ants allowing the user to move or modify the underlying graphic. Examples: Selection, Lasso, Rotate tools.
`AbstractTransformTool`  | Click-and-drag to select a rectangular boundary drawn with drag handles at each corner which can moved by the user. Example: Slant, projection, perspective and rubber sheet tools.

#### My canvas isn't getting garbage collected. This library has a memory leak.

The canvas registers itself as a listener to global event dispatchers so that you don't have to. Unfortunately, that means it'll never get cleaned up.

When you're done with a canvas, call `.dispose()` on the canvas object to allow the JVM to garbage collect it.

#### What about vector graphic tools (i.e., "draw" apps)?

Sorry, that's not the intent of this library. That said, many pieces of this library could be leveraged for such a tool...

#### I created a custom stroke using a line shape but it doesn't work. What gives?

The area defined by the stroke's shape is where the "pen" will produce ink. A line (or a curve) has no area and therefore produces no paint on the canvas. Use a thin `Rectangle2D` instead.
